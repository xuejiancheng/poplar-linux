HiSilicon STB PCIE/SATA/USB3 PHY

Properties:
- compatible: Should be "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-combphy"
- #phy-cells: Should be 1
	used to select the mode for phy
- clocks: The phandle to clock provider and clock specifier pair.
- resets: The phandle to reset controller and reset specifier pair.
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: Phandle to the peripheral controller.

Example:

combphy1: phy {
	compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-combphy";
	#phy-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&crg HISTB_COMBPHY1_CLK>;
	resets = <&crg 0x188 12>;
	assigned-clocks = <&crg HISTB_COMBPHY1_CLK>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <100000000>;
	hisilicon,peripheral-syscon = <&peri_ctrl>;
};
